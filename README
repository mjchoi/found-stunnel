=============

stunnel4 to found.no Elasticsearch clusters in Docker

### Why?
Logstash currently lacks SSL/TLS support out-of-box.  Alex from found.no has a great article on a workaround:
* [Tunneling SSL When Your Client Just Supports HTTP](https://www.found.no/documentation/security/stunneling-for-ssl/)

I just added the following for Docker:
```
foreground = yes
```

Thanks found.no
